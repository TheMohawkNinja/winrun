winrun is a simple way to run commands on a Windows machine from Linux and recieve the output.

DEPENDENCIES

	Requires installation of winrun_svr on the Windows machine which must be running when you want to run a command (so best to have it run on startup/login).

SYNTAX
	winrun [command]

	command: The command you want to run. make sure to wrap this in quotation marks if it contains spaces.

INSTALLATION

	compile with "g++ winrun.cpp -o winrun" and "g++ winrund.cpp -o winrund" and copy the executable to /usr/bin

CONFIGURATION

	You will need to create a text file called "config" located at "~/.config/winrun" and put the target IP in there.

	winrund, the daemon program for handling the network traffic, should be started on login. Connection and output logs are in journalctl.

KNOWN ISSUES

	Some "non-standard" characters (i.e. the vertical and horizontal lines in the "tree" command) don't output properly and can cause a crash.

	Output that changes within a given line will likely not output in the Linux terminal.
