winrun is a simple way to run commands on a Windows machine from Linux and recieve the output.

DEPENDENCIES

	Requires installation of winrun_svr on the Windows machine which must be running when you want to run a command (so best to have it run on startup/login).

SYNTAX
	winrun [command]

	command: The command you want to run. make sure to wrap this in quotation marks if it contains spaces.

INSTALLATION

	g++ compile lines are located at the first line of "winrun.cpp" and "winrund.cpp". Once compiled, copy the executables to /usr/bin

CONFIGURATION

	Copy the config file to "~/.config/winrund" and edit acccordingly.

	winrund, the daemon program for handling the network traffic, should be started on login. Logs are in journalctl.

KNOWN ISSUES

	Some "non-standard" characters (i.e. the vertical and horizontal lines in the "tree" command) don't output properly and can cause a crash.

	Output that changes within a given line will likely not output in the Linux terminal.
